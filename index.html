                    When you think about animated movies, it's Disney and Pixar that hog all the attention, but
                    DreamWorks
                    has
                    been doing a
                    great job as well with films like Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. DreamWorks has
                    also
                    been a lot
                    more aggressive when it comes to putting out sequels and spin-offs - and sometimes this goes
                    overboard
                    (witness Shrek,
                    Madagascar) - but it isn't always a bad thing either.

                    Kung Fu Panda 2 was an excellent, enjoyable film that actually improved upon the original in some
                    ways,
                    and
                    we called
                    How To Train Your Dragon 2 one of the best animated films in 2014. But the other thing that
                    DreamWorks
                    has
                    been doing is
                    covering the gaps in between movies with TV shows, and the latest one to be released is How to Train
                    Your
                    Dragon: Race
                    to the Edge. All 13 episodes of the show released a few days back on Netflix and if you're in India,
                    then
                    you won't be
                    able to watch them yet, but if you're reading this from the US, or you're one of the many people who
                    uses
                    Netflix over a
                    VPN or via services like UnoDNS, then we'd suggest you start watching this show.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also a good chance that the show will eventually air on an Indian channel - other shows like
                    House of Cards and
                    Orange is the New Black have made the jump, for example - and so, if you're at all interested in How
                    to Train Your
                    Dragon, or fun animated shows in general, then you should check this out.

                <h1>Why I like Dragon</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>It was a good idea and served as a useful bridge, but the new season isn't picking up after the
                        second film.</li>
                    <li>There's much more detail in the designs now, instead of the flattened textures we saw during the
                        earlier seasons.</li>
                    <li>The show also has the same cast as the movies; Jay Baruchel and America Ferrara return as Hiccup
                        and Astrid, as do the
                        supporting characters from the movies.</li>
